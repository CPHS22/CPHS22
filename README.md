# CPHS22 Workshop

## The Second International Workshop on Cyber-Physical-Human System Design and Implementation


**Full-day workshop at [CPS-IOT Week](https://cpsiotweek.neslab.it/index.php)**. The CPS-IOT Week contains five top conferences, HSCC, ICCPS, IPSN, RTAS, and IoTDI, multiple workshops, tutorials, and exhibitions. 

## Description

Cyber-physical-human systems (CPHS) are the foundation of many emerging applications such as home assistance, healthcare and wellbeing, smart infrastructure, smart manufacturing, and human-robot interactions. As an advanced subclass of CPS and IoT systems, CPHS emphasizes constructing human-friendly environments/devices and helping humans achieve their goals. Recent advance in AI has opened the possibility of scene and human behavior understanding to a new level. This human-centric view of CPHS significantly complicates system design and implementation in terms of open behavior states, implicit human intent, dynamic device composition, and ethics, privacy, and security concerns.

This workshop brings together academic, industrial, and government researchers to exchange CPHS design and implementation challenges and latest research results. We solicit invited papers and open submissions. Both will be reviewed based on their research vision and academic contribution.

Despite the best efforts of the whole organizing committee, the tail of the pandemic is preventing us from running CPS-IoT Week with an in-person component, as we planned originally. CPS-IoT Week will therefore run as a virtual event. Opting for this choice instead of a hybrid event was a tough decision where we had to strike a balance among several constraints. Detailed information, including registration options, will be available shortly on the website of CPS-IoT Week and of all its conferences and related events.

**Title:** ***Wearable Acoustic and Vibration Sensing and Machine Learning for Human Health and Performance***

Recent advances in digital health technologies are enabling biomedical researchers to reframe health optimization and disease treatment in a patient-specific, personalized manner. This talk will focus on my groupâ€™s research in three areas of relevance to digital health: (1) cardiogenic vibration sensing and analytics; (2) musculoskeletal sensing with joint acoustic emissions and bioimpedance; and (3) non-invasive neuromodulation for stress. Our group has extensively studied the timings and characteristics of cardiogenic vibration signals such as the ballistocardiogram and seismocardiogram, and applied these signals for cuffless blood pressure measurement, heart failure monitoring, and human performance. We have also leveraged miniature contact microphones to measure the sounds emitted by joints, such as the knees, in the context of movement, and have examined how these acoustic characteristics are altered by musculoskeletal injuries and disorders (e.g., arthritis). Finally, we have developed non-pharmacological treatment paradigms for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation, and have performed extensively validation of this approach with collaborators in psychiatry and radiology. We envision that these technologies can all contribute to improving patient care with lower cost.
