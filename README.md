# CPHS22 Workshop

## The Second International Workshop on Cyber-Physical-Human System Design and Implementation


**Full-day workshop at [CPS-IOT Week](https://cpsiotweek.neslab.it/index.php)**. The CPS-IOT Week contains five top conferences, HSCC, ICCPS, IPSN, RTAS, and IoTDI, multiple workshops, tutorials, and exhibitions. 

## Description

Cyber-physical-human systems (CPHS) are the foundation of many emerging applications such as home assistance, healthcare and wellbeing, smart infrastructure, smart manufacturing, and human-robot interactions. As an advanced subclass of CPS and IoT systems, CPHS emphasizes constructing human-friendly environments/devices and helping humans to achieve their goals. Recent advance in AI has opened the possibility of scene and human behavior understanding to a new level. This human-centric view of CPHS significantly complicates system design and implementation, in terms of open behavior states, implicit human intent, dynamic device composition, as well as ethics, privacy, and security concerns.

This workshop intends to bring together academic, industrial, and government researchers to exchange CPHS design and implementation challenges and latest research results. We will solicit invited papers and open submissions. Both papers will be reviewed based on their research vision and academic contribution. We will also solicit posters for early work.
