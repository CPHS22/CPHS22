# CPHS22 Workshop

## The Second International Workshop on Cyber-Physical-Human System Design and Implementation


**Full-day workshop at [CPS-IOT Week](https://cpsiotweek.neslab.it/index.php)**. The CPS-IOT Week contains five top conferences, HSCC, ICCPS, IPSN, RTAS, and IoTDI, multiple workshops, tutorials, and exhibitions. 

## Description

Cyber-physical-human systems (CPHS) are the foundation of many emerging applications such as home assistance, healthcare and wellbeing, smart infrastructure, smart manufacturing, and human-robot interactions. As an advanced subclass of CPS and IoT systems, CPHS emphasizes constructing human-friendly environments/devices and helping humans achieve their goals. Recent advance in AI has opened the possibility of scene and human behavior understanding to a new level. This human-centric view of CPHS significantly complicates system design and implementation in terms of open behavior states, implicit human intent, dynamic device composition, and ethics, privacy, and security concerns.

This workshop brings together academic, industrial, and government researchers to exchange CPHS design and implementation challenges and latest research results. We solicit invited papers and open submissions. Both will be reviewed based on their research vision and academic contribution.

Despite the best efforts of the whole organizing committee, the tail of the pandemic is preventing us from running CPS-IoT Week with an in-person component, as we planned originally. CPS-IoT Week will therefore run as a virtual event. Opting for this choice instead of a hybrid event was a tough decision where we had to strike a balance among several constraints. Detailed information, including registration options, will be available shortly on the website of CPS-IoT Week and of all its conferences and related events.

## Topics of Interest

## Submission Instructions

CPHS accepts double-blind paper submissions which have not been previously published. Posted technical reports (ArXiv or similar) do not count as prior publication and do not violate the double-blind requirement. Submitted papers must contain at most 6 pages (US letter, 9pt font size, double-column format, following the [IEEE conference proceedings template](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)), including all figures, tables, and references. All submissions must be written in English and should contain the authors' names, affiliations, and contact information.

Papers are to be submitted at <https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cphs22>. During the review process, the reviewers may anonymously communicate with the authors for clarifying questions.
